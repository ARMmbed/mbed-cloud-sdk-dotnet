The HTTP request is kept open until an event notification or a batch of event notifications are delivered to the client or the request times out (response code 204). In both cases, the client should open a new polling connection after the previous one closes. Only a single long polling connection per API key can be ongoing at any given time. You must have a persistent connection (Connection keep-alive header in the request) to avoid excess TLS handshakes.  The pull channel is implicitly created by the first GET call to &#x60;/v2/notification/pull&#x60;. It is refreshed on each GET call. If the channel is not polled for a long time (10 minutes) - it expires and will be deleted. This means that no notifications will stay in the queue between polls. A channel can be also deleted explicitly by a DELETE call.  **Note:** If you cannot have a public facing callback URL, for example when developing on your local machine, you can use long polling to check for new messages. However, **long polling is deprecated** and will likely be replaced in future. It is meant only for experimentation and not for commercial usage. The proper method to receive notifications is a **notification callback**. There can only be one notification channel per API key at a time in Device Management Connect. If a notification channel of other type already exists for the API key, you need to delete it before creating a long poll notification channel.  **Example usage:**      curl -X GET https://api.us-east-1.mbedcloud.com/v2/notification/pull -H &#39;authorization: Bearer {api-key}&#39;

The maximum length of the URL, header keys and values, all combined, is 400 characters. Notifications are delivered as PUT messages to the HTTP server defined by the client with a subscription server message. The given URL should be accessible and respond to the PUT request with response code of 200 or 204. Device Management Connect tests the callback URL with an empty payload when the URL is registered. For more information on notification messages, see [NotificationMessage](#NotificationMessage).  **Optional headers in a callback message:**  You can set optional headers to a callback in a **Webhook** object. Device Management Connect will include the header and key pairs to the notification messages send them to callback URL. As the callback URL&#39;s are API key specific also the headers are.  One possible use for the additional headers is to check the origin of a PUT request and also distinguish the application (API key) to which the notification belongs to.  **Note**: Only one callback URL per an API key can be active. If you register a new URL while another one is already active, it replaces the active one. There can be only one notification channel at a time. If another type of channel is already present, you need to delete it before setting the callback URL.  **Expiration of a callback URL:**  A callback can expire when Device Management cannot deliver a notification due to a connection timeout or an error response (4xx or 5xx). After each delivery failure, Device Management sets an exponential back off time and makes a retry attempt after that. The first retry delay is 1 second, then 2s, 4s, 8s, ..., 2min, 2min. The maximum retry delay is 2 minutes. The callback URL will be removed if all retries fail within 24 hours. More about [notification sending logic](/docs/current/integrate-web-app/event-notification.html#notification-sending-logic).  **Supported callback URL protocols:**  Currently, only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported.  **HTTPS callback URLs:**  When delivering a notification to an HTTPS based callback URL, Device Management Connect will present a valid client certificate to identify itself. The certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authorithy (GlobalSign) with a Common Name (CN) set to notifications.mbedcloud.com.  **Example usage:**  This example command shows how to set your callback URL and API key. It also sets an optional header authorization.

Notifications are delivered as PUT messages to the HTTP server defined by the client with a subscription server message. The given URL should be accessible and respond to the PUT request with response code of 200 or 204. Device Management Connect tests the callback URL with an empty payload when the URL is registered. For more information on notification messages, see [NotificationMessage](#NotificationMessage).  **Optional headers in a callback message:**  You can set optional headers to a callback in a **Webhook** object. Device Management Connect will include the header and key pairs to the notification messages send them to callback URL. As the callback URL&#39;s are API key specific also the headers are.  One possible use for the additional headers is to check the origin of a PUT request and also distinguish the application (API key) to which the notification belongs to.  **Note**: Only one callback URL per an API key can be active. If you register a new URL while another one is already active, it replaces the active one. There can be only one notification channel at a time. If another type of channel is already present, you need to delete it before setting the callback URL.  **Expiration of a callback URL:**  A callback can expire when Device Management cannot deliver a notification due to a connection timeout or an error response (4xx or 5xx). After each delivery failure, Device Management sets an exponential back off time and makes a retry attempt after that. The first retry delay is 1 second, then 2s, 4s, 8s, ..., 2min, 2min. The maximum retry delay is 2 minutes. The callback URL will be removed if all retries fail within 24 hours.

The certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authorithy (GlobalSign) with a Common Name (CN) set to notifications.mbedcloud.com.  **Example usage:**  This example command shows how to set your callback URL and API key.

To get notifications pushed, you also need to place the subscriptions. The maximum length of the URL, header keys and values, all combined, is 400 characters. Notifications are delivered as PUT messages to the HTTP server defined by the client with a subscription server message. The given URL should be accessible and respond to the PUT request with response code of 200 or 204. Device Management Connect tests the callback URL with an empty payload when the URL is registered. For more information on notification messages, see [NotificationMessage](#NotificationMessage).  **Optional headers in a callback message:**  You can set optional headers to a callback in a **Webhook** object. Device Management Connect will include the header and key pairs to the notification messages send them to callback URL. As the callback URL&#39;s are API key specific also the headers are.  One possible use for the additional headers is to check the origin of a PUT request and also distinguish the application (API key) to which the notification belongs to.  **Note**: Only one callback URL per an API key can be active. If you register a new URL while another one is already active, it replaces the active one. There can be only one notification channel at a time. If another type of channel is already present, you need to delete it before setting the callback URL.  **Expiration of a callback URL:**  A callback can expire when Device Management cannot deliver a notification due to a connection timeout or an error response (4xx or 5xx). After each delivery failure, Device Management sets an exponential back off time and makes a retry attempt after that. The first retry delay is 1 second, then 2s, 4s, 8s, ..., 2min, 2min. The maximum retry delay is 2 minutes. The callback URL will be removed if all retries fail within 24 hours. More about [notification sending logic](/docs/current/integrate-web-app/event-notification.html#notification-sending-logic).  **Supported callback URL protocols:**  Currently, only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported.  **HTTPS callback URLs:**  When delivering a notification to an HTTPS based callback URL, Device Management Connect will present a valid client certificate to identify itself. The certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authorithy (GlobalSign) with a Common Name (CN) set to notifications.mbedcloud.com.  **Example usage:**  This example command shows how to set your callback URL and API key.

        /// Register a callback URL Register a URL to which the server should deliver notifications of the subscribed resource changes. To get notifications pushed, you also need to place the subscriptions. The maximum length of the URL, header keys and values, all combined, is 400 characters. Notifications are delivered as PUT messages to the HTTP server defined by the client with a subscription server message. The given URL should be accessible and respond to the PUT request with response code of 200 or 204. Device Management Connect tests the callback URL with an empty payload when the URL is registered. For more information on notification messages, see [NotificationMessage](#NotificationMessage).  **Optional headers in a callback message:**  You can set optional headers to a callback in a **Webhook** object. Device Management Connect will include the header and key pairs to the notification messages send them to callback URL. As the callback URL&#39;s are API key specific also the headers are.  One possible use for the additional headers is to check the origin of a PUT request and also distinguish the application (API key) to which the notification belongs to.  **Note**: Only one callback URL per an API key can be active. If you register a new URL while another one is already active, it replaces the active one. There can be only one notification channel at a time. If another type of channel is already present, you need to delete it before setting the callback URL.  **Expiration of a callback URL:**  A callback can expire when Device Management cannot deliver a notification due to a connection timeout or an error response (4xx or 5xx). After each delivery failure, Device Management sets an exponential back off time and makes a retry attempt after that. The first retry delay is 1 second, then 2s, 4s, 8s, ..., 2min, 2min. The maximum retry delay is 2 minutes. The callback URL will be removed if all retries fail within 24 hours. More about [notification sending logic](/docs/current/integrate-web-app/event-notification.html#notification-sending-logic).  **Supported callback URL protocols:**  Currently, only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported.  **HTTPS callback URLs:**  When delivering a notification to an HTTPS based callback URL, Device Management Connect will present a valid client certificate to identify itself. The certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authorithy (GlobalSign) with a Common Name (CN) set to notifications.mbedcloud.com.  **Example usage:**  This example command shows how to set your callback URL and API key. It also sets an optional header authorization. When Device Management Connect calls your callback URL, the call contains the authorization header with the defined value.      curl -X PUT \\       https://api.us-east-1.mbedcloud.com/v2/notification/callback \\       -H &#39;authorization: Bearer {api-key}&#39; \\       -H &#39;content-type: application/json&#39; \\       -d &#39;{       \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;{callback-url}\&quot;,       \&quot;headers\&quot;: {\&quot;authorization\&quot; : \&quot;f4b93d6e-4652-4874-82e4-41a3ced0cd56\&quot;}       }&#39;
