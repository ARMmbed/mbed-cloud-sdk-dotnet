        /// Register a URL to which the server should deliver notifications of the subscribed resource changes. To get notifications pushed you need to also place the subscriptions.  The maximum length of URL, header keys and values, all combined, is 400 characters.  Notifications are delivered as PUT messages to the HTTP server defined by the client with a subscription server message.  The given URL should be accessible and respond to the PUT request with response code of 200 or 204. mbed Cloud Connect  tests the callback URL with an empty payload when the URL is registered. For more information on callback notification, see [NotificationMessage](/docs/v1.2/service-api-references/connect-api.html#notificationmessage).  **Optional headers in a callback message:**  You can set optional headers to a callback in a [Webhook](/docs/v1.2/service-api-references/connect-api.html#v2-notification-callback) object. The Mbed Cloud Connect will include the header and key pairs to the notification messages send to callback URL. As the callback URL&#39;s are API key specific also the headers are.   One possible use for the additional headers is to check the origin of a PUT request and also distinguish the application (API key) to which the notification belongs to.  **Note**: Only one callback URL per an API key can be active. If you register a new URL while another one is already active,  it replaces the active one. There can be only one notification channel at a time. If the Long Poll notification is already present  you need to delete it before setting the callback URL.  **Expiration of a callback URL:**   A callback can expire when mbed DS cannot deliver a notification due to a connection timeout or  error response (4xx or 5xx). After each delivery failure, mbed DS sets an exponential back off time and makes a retry attempt  after that. The first retry delay is 1 second, then 2s, 4s, 8s, ..., 2min, 2min. The maximum retry delay is 2 minutes.  The callback URL will be removed if all retries fail withing 24 hours. More about [notification sending logic](/docs/v1.2/connecting/event-notification.html).  **Example usage:**  This example command shows how to set your callback URL and API key. It also sets an optional header authorization. When Mbed Cloud Connect calls your callback URL, the call contains the authorization header with the defined value.          curl -X PUT \\       https://api.us-east-1.mbedcloud.com/v2/notification/callback \\       -H &#39;authorization: Bearer {api-key}&#39; \\       -H &#39;content-type: application/json&#39; \\       -d &#39;{       \&quot;url\&quot;: \&quot;{callback-url}\&quot;,       \&quot;headers\&quot;: {\&quot;authorization\&quot; : \&quot;f4b93d6e-4652-4874-82e4-41a3ced0cd56\&quot;}       }&#39;

To get notifications pushed you need to also place the subscriptions.  The maximum length of URL, header keys and values, all combined, is 400 characters.  Notifications are delivered as PUT messages to the HTTP server defined by the client with a subscription server message.  The given URL should be accessible and respond to the PUT request with response code of 200 or 204. mbed Cloud Connect  tests the callback URL with an empty payload when the URL is registered. For more information on callback notification, see [NotificationMessage](/docs/v1.2/service-api-references/connect-api.html#notificationmessage).  **Optional headers in a callback message:**  You can set optional headers to a callback in a [Webhook](/docs/v1.2/service-api-references/connect-api.html#v2-notification-callback) object. The Mbed Cloud Connect will include the header and key pairs to the notification messages send to callback URL. As the callback URL&#39;s are API key specific also the headers are.   One possible use for the additional headers is to check the origin of a PUT request and also distinguish the application (API key) to which the notification belongs to.  **Note**: Only one callback URL per an API key can be active. If you register a new URL while another one is already active,  it replaces the active one. There can be only one notification channel at a time. If the Long Poll notification is already present  you need to delete it before setting the callback URL.  **Expiration of a callback URL:**   A callback can expire when mbed DS cannot deliver a notification due to a connection timeout or  error response (4xx or 5xx). After each delivery failure, mbed DS sets an exponential back off time and makes a retry attempt  after that. The first retry delay is 1 second, then 2s, 4s, 8s, ..., 2min, 2min. The maximum retry delay is 2 minutes.  The callback URL will be removed if all retries fail withing 24 hours. More about [notification sending logic](/docs/v1.2/connecting/event-notification.html).  **Example usage:**  This example command shows how to set your callback URL and API key. It also sets an optional header authorization.
